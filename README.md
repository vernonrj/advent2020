Solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), written in Rust.

All solutions can be built/tested at once by executing `cargo build --all` or `cargo test --all` at the toplevel.

To run a specific solution, move your working directory to one of the days and use `cargo run --release` to run the code for that specific day. Most days take an input file, which is contained within each day's directory as a sibling to the day's `Cargo.toml` file.
